# polarVolcaNoseR
 
PolarVolcaNoseR provides a way to display multiple Volcano plots side-by-side. It is an extension of the common Volcano plot (see also: ).

Here, it is used to display the results of a proteomic screen for SUMO targets.

### Running the App

The app is available online: [https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/PolaRVolcaNoseR/](https://amsterdamstudygroup.shinyapps.io/PolaRVolcaNoseR/)

But you can also run it offline in R/Rstudio. To run the app locally, you'll need the following packages: shiny, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, magrittr, ggrepel, glue, scales, ggiraph, htmlwidgets.

### Example output

Standard output generated with the included data:

A linear output of the same data is also availavle in the app:

### Credits

The original idea of the polar representation was from Román González-Prieto and it was implemented by Joachim Goedhart.
